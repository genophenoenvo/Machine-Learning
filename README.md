# Machine-Learning

This repository contains the code for the machine learning experiments for days to flowering and days to flag leaf emergence phenotypic traits of *Sorghum B* . 

-The trait datasets can be accessed from [here](https://github.com/genophenoenvo/terraref-datasets).
-For genomic data:
	-Distance matrix : (https://data.monarchinitiative.org/genophenoenvo/tassel5/distance/all_cultivars_distance.txt)
	-Gene clusters :  (https://github.com/genophenoenvo/genomic_data/blob/master/FriendsOfEntropy/cultivar_k30cluster_score.dataframe)
